# Interactive Data Visualization with Bokeh
This repository contains my practise files and application s made using Bokeh visualisation tools.

# Day 1
- Started a new course of Data visualisations using Bokeh. This is the walkthrough code from Data Camp which I'm doing along with the course.
- Learned about Glyphs, then moved onto learn how to plot glyphs.
- Made a simple scatter plot, scatter plot with different shapes and how to customise scatter plots.


# Day 2
- Worked on plotting data using numpy arrays. 
- Implemented lines in Bokeh for a given data.
- Implemented lines with markers in a plot.
- Implemented Patches for a given data.

# Day 3
- Practiced hover tool using and worked on customizing the hover tool.
- Worked on Bokeh palettes for color mapping.
- Worked on plotting data using Data Frames with Bokeh.
- Making selection and non-selection Glyphs.
- Worked on ColumnDataSource object in Bokeh.

# Day 4
- Implemented the column() function to create a single column layout of the plots.
- Implemented the row() function to create a single column layout of the plots.
- Implemented Nested layout to plot the combination of column() and row() plots from the data.

# Day 5
- Created Regular grids of Bokeh plots with gridplot.
- Created tabbed layouts in Bokeh by placing plots or layouts in Panels.
- Implemented the display of tabbed layouts.
- Inplemented Linking axes between plots by sharing range objects.

# Day 6
- Implemented basic drawing of the twitter network using NetworkX.
- Learned how to run basic Queries on a graph practiced using NetworkX's drawing facilities to visualize components of it.
- Learned about Directed/Un-Directed Single/ Multi-Edge Graph.
- Learned about specifying a weight on edges and implemented the code on Twitter dataset.

# Day 8
- Learned about Legends, and implemented them bu adding legends to Glyphs.
- Implemented Positioning and styling on legends by changing the attributes.
- Wroked on addign a hover tool tip to easily store data in a ColumnDataSource.

# Day 9
- Started working on a Bokeh interactive app. Got started with the current document.
- Added a single plot to the "current document" of the application. Practiced adding a layout to your current document.
- Implemented multiple sliders in the application.
